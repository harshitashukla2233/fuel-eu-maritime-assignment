# AI Agent Reflection

## Learning Outcomes
- AI agents significantly accelerated coding, especially for repetitive frontend components and boilerplate backend APIs.
- Using Copilot for React + Tailwind reduced layout setup time by ~50%.
- Claude Code helped refactor complex domain logic for Banking and Pooling, ensuring correctness and readability.

## Efficiency Gains
- Manual coding would have taken ~12–15 hours; AI assistance reduced implementation time to ~6–7 hours.
- Test stubs and validation functions generated via Cursor Agent saved additional ~2 hours.

## Improvements Next Time
- More structured prompt design to reduce trial-and-error iterations.
- Integrate AI earlier in architecture planning, not just code generation.
- Include automated checks for AI outputs to prevent hallucinated logic.
- Document AI interactions continuously during development for transparency.

## Summary
AI agents are effective collaborators, not replacements. Their output must be validated, refactored, and aligned with domain logic. The combination of multiple agents enabled faster development while maintaining architectural clarity and correctness.
